<br>
In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian approach for estimating a gene network's topology using particle Gibbs 
sampling. The conditional posterior distributions of the unknowns in a state-space model describing the time evolution 
of gene expressions are derived and employed for exact Bayesian posterior inference. Specifically, the proposed scheme 
provides the joint posterior distribution of the unknown gene expressions, the adjacency matrix describing the topology 
of the network, and the coefficient matrix describing the strength of the gene interactions. We validate the proposed 
method with numerical simulations on synthetic data experiments.
