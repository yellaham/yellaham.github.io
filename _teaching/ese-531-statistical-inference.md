## Course Description

This graduate-level course covers fundamental concepts in statistical inference and estimation theory, including parameter estimation, hypothesis testing, and Bayesian methods.

### Topics
- **Properties of random samples** – definition of a random sample, population distribution, definition of a
statistic, sampling distribution, sample mean, sample variance, probability inequalities, convergence of
random variables, weak and strong law of large numbers, central limit theorem, delta method,
- **Point estimation** – maximum likelihood estimation, method of moments estimation, sufficient statistics,
exponential families, single and multi-parameter estimation, methods for estimation (e.g., analytical, and
numerical optimization, expectation maximization), point estimation under parameter constraints,
Gaussian mixture models,
- **Evaluation of estimators** – mean-squared error criterion, bias-variance tradeoff, unbiased estimators,
minimum variance criterion; existence of minimum variance unbiased estimators, Fisher information,
Cramer-Rao bounds, properties of maximum likelihood estimators, predictive performance,
- **Linear models** – definition and properties, maximum likelihood estimation for linear models, noise model,
colored noise model, best linear unbiased estimator
- **Bayesian estimators** – Bayesian vs. frequentist philosophies, Bayes’ theorem, conjugate priors, MAP
estimation, MMSE estimation, Jeffrey’s prior, examples of Bayesian inference, approximate Bayesian
inference, Laplace approximation, Monte Carlo methods, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm,
- **Detection theory** – Binary hypothesis testing, type-I and type-II errors, simple and composite hypothesis
testing, Neyman-Pearson theorem, likelihood ratio test, receiver operating characteristics, probability of
error, multiple hypothesis testing, generalized likelihood ratio test, examples of various detectors
