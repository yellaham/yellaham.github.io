Adaptive importance sampling (AIS) methods are a family of algorithms which can be used to approximate Bayesian 
posterior distributions. Many AIS algorithms exist in the literature, where the differences arise in the manner by which 
the proposal distribution is adapted at each iteration. The adaptive population importance sampler (APIS), for example, 
deterministically samples from a mixture distribution and uses the local information given by the samples and weights to 
adapt the location parameter of each proposal. The update rules by nature are heuristic, but effective, especially in 
the case that the target posterior is multimodal. In this work, we introduce a novel AIS scheme which incorporates 
modern techniques in stochastic optimization to improve the methodology for higher-dimensional posterior inference. More 
specifically, we derive update rules for the parameters of each proposal by means of deterministic mixture sampling and 
show that the method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in high-dimensional scenarios.
