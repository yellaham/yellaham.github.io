Importance sampling (IS) is a Monte Carlo methodology that allows for approximation of a target distribution using 
weighted samples generated from another proposal distribution. Adaptive importance sampling (AIS) implements an 
iterative version of IS which adapts the parameters of the proposal distribution in order to improve estimation of the 
target. While the adaptation of the location (mean) of the proposals has been largely studied, an important challenge of 
AIS relates to the difficulty of adapting the scale parameter (covariance matrix). In the case of weight degeneracy, 
adapting the covariance matrix using the empirical covariance results in a singular matrix, which leads to poor 
performance in subsequent iterations of the algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme which exploits recent 
advances in the IS literature to prevent the so-called weight degeneracy. The method efficiently adapts the covariance 
matrix of a population of proposal distributions and achieves a significant performance improvement in high-dimensional 
scenarios. We validate the new method through computer simulations.
