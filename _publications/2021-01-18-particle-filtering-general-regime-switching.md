<br>
In this paper, we consider a new framework for particle filtering under model uncertainty that operates beyond the scope 
of Markovian switching systems. Specifically, we develop a novel particle filtering algorithm that applies to general 
regime switching systems, where the model index is augmented as an unknown time-varying parameter in the system. The 
proposed approach does not require the use of multiple filters and can maintain a diverse set of particles for each 
considered model through appropriate choice of the particle filtering proposal distribution. The flexibility of the 
proposed approach allows for long-term dependencies between the models, which enables its use to a wider variety of 
real-world applications. We validate the method on a synthetic data experiment and show that it outperforms 
state-of-the-art multiple model particle filtering approaches that require the use of multiple filters.
