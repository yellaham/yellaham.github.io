<br>
In this paper we propose a powerful frequency, phase angle, and amplitude estimation solution for an unbalanced 
three-phase power system based on multiple model adaptive estimation. The proposed model utilizes the existence of a 
conditionally linear and Gaussian substructure in the power system states by marginalizing out the frequency component. 
This substructure can be effectively tracked by a bank of Kalman filters where each filter employs a different angular 
frequency value. Compared to other Bayesian filtering schemes for estimation in three-phase power systems, the proposed 
model reformulation is simpler, more robust, and more accurate as validated with numerical simulations on synthetic 
data.
