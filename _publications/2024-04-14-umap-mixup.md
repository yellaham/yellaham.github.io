Data augmentation techniques play an important role in enhancing the performance of deep learning models. Despite 
their proven benefits in computer vision tasks, their application in the other domains remains limited. This paper 
proposes a Mixup regularization scheme, referred to as UMAP Mixup, designed for "on-manifold" automated data 
augmentation for deep learning predictive models. The proposed approach ensures that the Mixup operations result in 
synthesized samples that lie on the data manifold of the features and labels by utilizing a dimensionality reduction 
technique known as uniform manifold approximation and projection. Evaluations across diverse regression tasks show that 
UMAP Mixup is competitive with or outperforms other Mixup variants, show promise for its potential as an effective tool 
for enhancing the generalization performance of deep learning models.
