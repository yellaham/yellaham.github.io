The adaptive multiple importance sampling (AMIS) algorithm is a powerful Monte Carlo tool for Bayesian estimation in 
intractable models. The uniqueness of this methodology from other adaptive importance sampling (AIS) schemes is in the 
weighting procedure, where at each iteration of the algorithm, all samples are re-weighted according to the temporal 
deterministic mixture approach. This re-weighting allows for substantial variance reduction of the AMIS estimator, 
at the expense of an increased computational cost that grows quadratically with the number of iterations. In this paper, 
we propose a novel AIS methodology which obtains most of the AMIS variance reduction while improving upon its 
computational complexity. The proposed method implements an approximate version of the temporal deterministic mixture 
approach and requires substantially less computation. Advantages are shown empirically through a numerical example, 
where the novel method is able to attain a desired mean-squared error with much less computation.
